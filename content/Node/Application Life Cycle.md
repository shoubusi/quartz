describe the stages of Windows Forms Application Life Cycle[^1]

Based on the documentation, the key stages of the Windows Forms Application Life Cycle in XAF are:

1. Application is created
   - The WinApplication object is instantiated and initialized

2. Splash screen is invoked
   - The ISplash.Start method is called to show the splash screen form

3. An end-user is authenticated 
   - Either using a logon window or without a logon window

4. Start-up Popup Window Show Actions are executed
   - Actions registered as start-up actions in modules are displayed in popup windows

5. Main window is shown
   - The ShowViewStrategy creates and displays the main application window

6. Splash screen is closed
   - The ISplash.Stop method is called to close the splash screen

7. Main window is displayed until a user closes it
   - The user can interact with the application
   - The main window can be closed via the Exit or LogOff actions

Some key points about this lifecycle:

- There are opportunities to customize behavior at various stages, like authentication, startup actions, etc.

- The splash screen is shown early and closed after the main window is ready

- Authentication happens before the main UI is displayed

- The application uses a ShowViewStrategy to handle displaying windows/views

- The lifecycle ends when the user explicitly closes the main window

This structured lifecycle allows XAF to handle initialization, authentication, and UI display in a consistent way across applications while still allowing customization.
