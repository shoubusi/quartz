# Choosing between anonymous and tuple types


https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/choosing-between-anonymous-and-tuple


The article titled "Choosing between anonymous and tuple types" from Microsoft Learn discusses the considerations for selecting between anonymous types and tuple types in .NET. Here's a summary of the main points:

1. **Usability and Functionality**:
   - Anonymous types, introduced in C# 3.0, are often used with LINQ to project query results into types that contain selected properties.
   - Tuples, available since .NET Framework 4.0, can also be used in LINQ queries to select properties. 
   - ValueTuple, introduced later, provides the flexibility of anonymous types with the performance of value types.

2. **Tradeoffs**:
   - ValueTuple is mutable, unlike the immutable Tuple.
   - Anonymous types can be used in expression trees, which is not possible with tuples.
   - The table in the article provides an overview of key differences, including access modifiers, type, custom member names, and support for deconstruction and expression tree support.

3. **Key Differences**:
   - Anonymous types have an `internal` access modifier, are a `class`, support custom member names, do not support deconstruction, and do support expression trees.
   - Tuples are `public` classes, do not support custom member names or deconstruction, and support expression trees.
   - ValueTuples are `public` structs, support custom member names and deconstruction, but do not support expression trees.

4. **Serialization**:
   - If serialization is a requirement, it's generally better to create a `class` or `struct` instead of using anonymous types or tuples, as serialization involves converting an object's state to a persistable or transportable form.

5. **Performance**:
   - The performance of these types can vary based on the scenario, with the main impact being the tradeoff between allocations and copying.
   - The article suggests that in most cases, the performance impact is small, but in scenarios where it could be significant, performance measurements should be taken.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The choice between tuples and anonymous types should be based on several factors.
   - ValueTuple is recommended when not working with expression trees and when the developer is comfortable with tuple syntax, as it provides a value type with the ability to name properties.
   - Anonymous types are preferred when working with expression trees and when property naming is desired.
   - Tuples should be used in other cases where a simple, immutable, and reference-type tuple is needed.

7. **See Also**:
   - The article concludes with references to related topics such as anonymous types, expression trees, tuple types in C# and Visual Basic, and type design guidelines.

This article serves as a guide for .NET developers to make informed decisions when choosing between anonymous types and tuple types based on their specific use case requirements.

give examples to explain the difference between anonymous and tuple types and ValueTuple

## Choosing Between Anonymous and Tuple Types

In C#, you can represent collections of data using both **anonymous types** and **tuples**. While both serve similar purposes, they have distinct characteristics that make them suitable for different scenarios. 

**Let's explore the differences with examples:**

**1. Anonymous Types:**

* **Definition:** Anonymous types are created on-the-fly without a predefined name. They are defined inline using curly braces `{}` and accessed by their properties.
* **Example:**

```csharp
var person = new { Name = "Alice", Age = 30, City = "New York" };
Console.WriteLine(person.Name); // Output: Alice
```

* **Advantages:** Concise syntax for representing simple data structures. Useful when you need a temporary data structure for a specific operation.
* **Disadvantages:**

    * Can be less readable than named types, especially for complex structures.
    * Cannot be used as generic type parameters or in inheritance.

**2. Tuples:**

* **Definition:** Tuples are fixed-size collections of values of different types, enclosed in parentheses `()`. They have named elements starting from Item1, Item2, etc.
* **Example:**

```csharp
var coordinates = (x: 10, y: 20);
Console.WriteLine(coordinates.x); // Output: 10
```

* **Advantages:**

    * More expressive than anonymous types for representing data with distinct meanings.
    * Can be used as generic type parameters and in inheritance.
    * Support named elements for better readability.

* **Disadvantages:**

    * Less concise syntax compared to anonymous types for simple data structures.
    * Fixed size, cannot be easily resized after creation.

**3. ValueTuple:**

* **Definition:** ValueTuple is a special type of tuple that is value-type instead of reference-type. It offers improved performance and memory efficiency compared to regular tuples.
* **Example:**

```csharp
var point = new ValueTuple<int, int>(10, 20);
```

* **Advantages:**

    * Performance improvements due to value-type nature.
    * Reduced memory consumption compared to regular tuples.

* **Disadvantages:**

    * Less flexible than regular tuples as they are immutable.
    * Requires explicit type definition using `ValueTuple<T1, T2, ...>` syntax.

**Choosing the Right Type:**

* **Anonymous Types:** Use for simple, temporary data structures where conciseness is prioritized.
* **Tuples:** Use for representing data with distinct meanings and when you need named elements for readability.
* **ValueTuple:** Use when performance and memory efficiency are critical, and the tuple data is immutable.

**Key Differences Illustrated:**

- **Mutability**: Anonymous types and Tuples are immutable once created, whereas ValueTuples are mutable.
- **Property Names**: Anonymous types and ValueTuples can have named properties/elements, which makes the code more readable compared to the indexed properties of Tuples.
- **Type Safety**: Anonymous types and Tuples are reference types, while ValueTuples are value types, which can have implications for performance and behavior, especially when used as function return types or within collections.
- **Usage in Expression Trees**: Anonymous types can be used in expression trees, which is useful for LINQ to Entities and other scenarios where expression trees are required. Tuples and ValueTuples cannot be used in expression trees.



help me to choose between ValueTuple and Struct in csharp

Choosing between `ValueTuple` and a custom `struct` in C# depends on your specific use case. Here's a concise comparison to help you decide:

Use `ValueTuple` when:

1. You need a quick, lightweight way to group 2-7 values
2. You don't need named fields (though you can use named tuples)
3. The grouping is short-lived or used internally
4. You want to leverage tuple deconstruction syntax
5. You need implicit conversion between compatible tuples

Use a custom `struct` when:

1. You need more than 7 fields
2. You want meaningful field names in the type definition
3. You need to add methods or properties to the type
4. You want to implement interfaces
5. You need to control the memory layout (using StructLayout attribute)
6. You want to create a reusable, self-contained type

Example comparisons:

```csharp
// ValueTuple
(int X, int Y) point = (10, 20);

// Struct
struct Point
{
    public int X;
    public int Y;

    public Point(int x, int y) { X = x; Y = y; }
    public double Distance() => Math.Sqrt(X*X + Y*Y);
}

Point p = new Point(10, 20);
```


In general, use `ValueTuple` for simple, temporary groupings, and use `struct` for more complex, reusable types with behavior.
