Data Seeding


https://docs.abp.io/en/abp/latest/Data-Seeding


After I create a new ABP solution with Module Startup Template, I write a DataSeedContributor class implemented IDataSeedContributor.

how to start the data seed process and execute this DataSeedContributor with ABP's Data Seed System.

In Application Startup Template, I can start the data seed process by run the .DbMigrator Project, but in a Module Startup Template there is no .DbMigrator Project
