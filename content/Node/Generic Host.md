# .NET Generic Host

<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/generic-host>

## What is the .NET Generic Host

> In context of Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting, what is the .NET Generic Host, and when should I use it

**What is the .NET Generic Host?**

The `.NET Generic Host` is a framework provided by Microsoft in the `Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting` NuGet package. It's a set of abstraction layers that simplify hosting your .NET Core application. The generic host provides a way to configure and run various types of applications, such as web APIs, console apps, and Windows services.

**What does it do?**

The generic host offers several benefits:

1. **Simplified configuration**: You can easily configure logging, dependency injection (DI), and other aspects of your application.
2. **Consistent programming model**: The generic host provides a consistent way to write code for different types of applications.
3. **Abstraction from underlying infrastructure**: You don't need to worry about the specifics of hosting your application (e.g., web server, console app, or Windows service).

**When should I use it?**

Use the .NET Generic Host when:

1. **You're building a .NET Core application**: The generic host is designed specifically for .NET Core applications.
2. **You need to write reusable code**: If you want to share logic between different types of applications, the generic host can help.
3. **You want a consistent programming model**: Use the generic host when you want to benefit from its simplified configuration and abstraction layers.

**When not to use it?**

1. **Legacy .NET Framework applications**: The generic host is designed for .NET Core, so if you're building an application using the older .NET Framework, this might not be the best choice.
2. **Simple console or Windows service apps**: If your application doesn't require complex configuration or dependency injection, a simple `Main` method and some basic `using` statements might suffice.

In summary, the .NET Generic Host is a valuable framework for building robust, reusable .NET Core applications that require simplified configuration and abstraction layers.

## Functionality

> explain following content in context of Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting

A *host* is an object that encapsulates an app's resources and lifetime functionality, such as:

- Dependency injection (DI)
- Logging
- Configuration
- App shutdown
- `IHostedService` implementations

In the context of Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting, a host is an object that represents the application's runtime environment. It provides a set of features and services that enable you to manage your application's lifetime and resources.

A host in this sense is similar to a container or a framework that manages dependencies, logging, configuration, shutdown, and other essential components for your application. This concept is often referred to as "hosting" or "containerized hosting".

Here are some key features of the Generic Host:

1. **Dependency Injection (DI)**: The host provides an instance of `IServiceProvider` which can be used to resolve dependencies using the built-in DI system.
2. **Logging**: The host includes a default implementation of `ILogger<T>` that you can use for logging purposes.
3. **Configuration**: The host provides access to configuration settings through the `IConfiguration` interface, allowing you to read and write appsettings.json or other configuration files.
4. **App shutdown**: The host manages application shutdown, providing a way to execute code when the application is shutting down or terminated.
5. **IHostedService implementations**: You can register instances of `IHostedService` with the host, which allows you to run background services that need to be executed during app startup or shutdown.

By using the Generic Host, you can create a decoupled and modular architecture for your application, making it easier to develop, test, and maintain. The host abstracts away many of the underlying details, allowing you to focus on writing business logic code without worrying about infrastructure concerns.

## Add services to the DI container

> In context of Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting, how to use the host builder to add services to the DI container.

**Generic Host**

The `IHost` interface in .NET Core's `Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting` namespace provides a way to build and run an application with dependency injection (DI) using the service provider pattern.

Here's an example of how to use the host builder to add services to the DI container:

```csharp
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;

// Create a new instance of IHostBuilder
var host = Host.CreateDefaultBuilder();

// Use the ConfigureServices method to configure your services
host.ConfigureServices(services =>
{
    // Add any services you want using IServiceCollection's methods, such as:
    services.AddTransient<MyService>();
});

// Start the host and run it until it is stopped.
await host.RunConsoleAsync();
```

In this example:

1. We create a new instance of `IHostBuilder` by calling `Host.CreateDefaultBuilder()`.
2. We use the `ConfigureServices` method to configure our services with the service provider.
3. Inside the callback, we add any services using methods provided by `IServiceCollection`, such as `AddTransient<MyService>()`.
4. Finally, we start the host and run it until it is stopped using `RunConsoleAsync()`.

You can also use this approach to configure your application's services in a more complex way, for example:

```csharp
host.ConfigureServices((services, environment) =>
{
    // Add any services you want based on the environment.
    if (environment.IsDevelopment())
    {
        services.AddTransient<MyDevService>();
    }
});
```

In this case, we use the `ConfigureServices` method with a lambda that takes both an instance of `IServiceCollection` and an instance of `IHostEnvironment`, which represents the current host's environment. We then add different services based on whether we are in development or not.

By using the host builder to configure your application's services, you can decouple your service registration from your application code, making it easier to manage and maintain large applications with complex dependencies.

## Configure logging

In context of Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting, how to use the host builder to configure logging.

When using the `IHostBuilder` interface in Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting, you can configure logging by adding services and configuring options for a logging provider.

Here's an example:

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;

public class Program
{
    public static IHostBuilder CreateHostBuilder(string[] args) =>
        Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
            .ConfigureLogging(logging =>
            {
                logging.AddConsole();
                // Add other logging providers as needed, such as rolling files or a database.
            })
            .UseStartup<Program>();
}
```

In this example:

1. The `CreateHostBuilder` method is used to create the host builder instance.
2. The `ConfigureLogging` method is called on the host builder to configure logging providers.
3. In this case, we're adding a console logger using the `AddConsole` method.

To use different logging providers or customize existing ones, you can add other methods as needed:

```csharp
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;

public class Program
{
    public static IHostBuilder CreateHostBuilder(string[] args) =>
        Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
            .ConfigureLogging(logging =>
            {
                logging.AddConsole();
                logging.AddFilter<Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.FileLogProvider>("Microsoft", LogLevel.Warning);
                // Add other logging providers as needed, such as rolling files or a database.
            })
            .UseStartup<Program>();
}
```

Here's an example of using the `AddFile` method to add a file-based logger:

```csharp
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;

public class Program
{
    public static IHostBuilder CreateHostBuilder(string[] args) =>
        Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
            .ConfigureLogging(logging =>
            {
                logging.AddConsole();
                logging.AddFile("logs/app.log");
                // Add other logging providers as needed, such as rolling files or a database.
            })
            .UseStartup<Program>();
}
```

By using the host builder to configure logging, you can easily manage and customize your application's logging configuration.

## Set up the application's configuration settings

In context of Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting, how to use the host builder to set up the application's configuration settings.

To set up an application's configuration settings using the `IHostBuilder` interface in `Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting`, you can follow these steps:

**Step 1:** Create a new instance of `IHostBuilder`

```csharp
var host = Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args);
```

This will create a default builder for your application.

**Step 2:** Configure the settings using the `ConfigureAppConfiguration` method

```csharp
host.ConfigureAppConfiguration((hostingContext, config) =>
{
    // Set configuration values here
});
```

In this example, we're passing in an action that takes two parameters: `hostingContext` and `config`. The `hostingContext` parameter provides information about the hosting context (e.g., environment variables), while the `config` parameter is an instance of `IConfiguration`.

**Step 3:** Set configuration values

```csharp
config.Set("MySetting1", "Value1");
config.Set("MySetting2", "Value2");
```

In this example, we're setting two configuration settings: `MySetting1` with value `"Value1"` and `MySetting2` with value `"Value2"`.

**Step 4:** Build the host

```csharp
var host = host.Build();
```

This will build the host instance based on the configurations you've set up.

Here's a complete example:

```csharp
using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        var host = Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args).ConfigureAppConfiguration((hostingContext, config) =>
        {
            config.Set("MySetting1", "Value1");
            config.Set("MySetting2", "Value2");
        }).Build();

        // Use the configured settings
        Console.WriteLine($"MySetting1: {host.Configuration["MySetting1"]}");
        Console.WriteLine($"MySetting2: {host.Configuration["MySetting2"]}");
    }
}
```

In this example, we're creating a host instance and configuring it to set two configuration settings. We then build the host and use the configured settings in our program.

Remember that you can also load configuration values from external sources like environment variables, files, or databases using various extension methods provided by `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration`.

## Application's lifecycle

In context of Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting, how to use the host to take care of the application's lifecycle and the execution of `IHostedService` implementations.

Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting is a .NET Standard library that provides a simple way to create web applications or services that can be hosted in various environments, such as IIS, self-hosted, or Docker containers.

Here are some steps on how to use the host to take care of the application's lifecycle and execute `IHostedService` implementations:

**Step 1: Create an instance of** `IWebHostBuilder`

To start using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting, you need to create an instance of `IWebHostBuilder`. You can do this by calling the `CreateDefaultBuilder` method:

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateDefaultBuilder(args);
```

This will create a default builder with settings for [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Core.

**Step 2: Configure the host**

You can configure the host using various methods on the `IWebHostBuilder`. For example, you can specify the port number or set up logging:

```csharp
builder.UseUrls("http://localhost:5000");
builder.UseSerilog();
```

**Step 3: Add services to the host**

Next, add any services your application requires. In this case, we're interested in adding `IHostedService` implementations:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddHostedService<MyBackgroundService>();
```

Replace `MyBackgroundService` with the name of your custom implementation.

**Step 4: Start the host**

Finally, start the host using the `Build` method:

```csharp
var host = builder.Build();
```

This will start the host and execute any registered `IHostedService` implementations. The `StartAsync` method on each service will be called when the application starts.

**Step 5: Stop the host**

When you're done, don't forget to stop the host:

```csharp
await host.StopAsync();
```

This ensures that your services are properly shut down and resources are released.

Here's a complete example:

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;

class Program
{
    static async System.Threading.Tasks.Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        var builder = WebApplication.CreateDefaultBuilder(args);

        builder.UseUrls("http://localhost:5000");
        builder.UseSerilog();

        builder.Services.AddHostedService<MyBackgroundService>();

        var host = builder.Build();
        await host.StartAsync();

        // Do some work...

        await host.StopAsync();
    }
}
```

By following these steps, you can use the `IWebHost` to manage your application's lifecycle and execute custom services using the `IHostedService` interface.

## CreateApplicationBuilder and CreateDefaultBuilder

in context of .NET Generic Host, when set up a host, what is the difference between CreateApplicationBuilder and CreateDefaultBuilder

In the context of .NET Generic Host, `CreateApplicationBuilder` and `CreateDefaultBuilder` are two methods used to configure an instance of `IHostBuilder`, which is responsible for building and configuring a host. The main difference between them lies in their default configuration and behavior.

**1.** `CreateDefaultBuilder`:

This method creates a builder with some default settings, such as:

- Enabling the console logging provider
- Configuring the host to run asynchronously (i.e., using `HostBuilder.RunAsync`)
- Setting up the application's entry point (i.e., the `Main` method)
  - When using `CreateApplicationBuilder` in the context of .NET Generic Host, you need to add `await host.RunAsync();` in the `Main` method. However, when using `CreateDefaultBuilder`, `await host.RunAsync();` is not needed as it is handled internally.

Using this method is equivalent to calling `CreateDefaultBuilder().UseConsoleLifetime()`.

**2.** `CreateApplicationBuilder`:

This method creates a builder with more basic settings, without any default logging or lifetime configuration. It simply provides a blank slate for you to configure your host as needed.

In other words, `CreateApplicationBuilder` gives you more control over the host's configuration, allowing you to customize everything from scratch.

Here are some key differences:

- **Default logging**: `CreateDefaultBuilder` enables console logging by default, whereas `CreateApplicationBuilder` does not.
- **Lifetime configuration**: `CreateDefaultBuilder` sets up an asynchronous lifetime (i.e., using `HostBuilder.RunAsync`) by default, while `CreateApplicationBuilder` leaves this setting to you.
- **Entry point**: Both methods set the application's entry point (i.e., the `Main` method), but `CreateDefaultBuilder` also configures the host to run asynchronously.

When to use each:

- Use `CreateDefaultBuilder` when you want a basic, out-of-the-box configuration for your host.
- Use `CreateApplicationBuilder` when you need more control over the host's configuration and want to customize everything from scratch.

I hope this helps clarify the difference between these two methods!

when using `.NET Generic Host`, how to set environment

## Generic Host and Environment Settings

The `.NET Generic Host` provides a flexible and powerful way to run your .NET applications. Setting the environment within your Generic Host application is crucial for configuring behavior based on different deployment scenarios (development, testing, production).

Here's how you can set the environment in your `.NET Generic Host` application:

**1. Using Environment Variables:**

The simplest way is to leverage environment variables.

- **Set the Environment Variable:** Before running your application, set the `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT` environment variable to your desired environment name (e.g., "Development", "Staging", "Production"). You can do this in your terminal or command prompt.

- **Access in Code:** In your `Program.cs` file, access the environment variable within your `ConfigureHostBuilder` method:

```csharp
var hostBuilder = Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
    .ConfigureAppConfiguration((context, builder) =>
    {
        builder.AddEnvironmentVariables(); // Adds environment variables to configuration
    });

// ... rest of your configuration
```

- **Configuration Files:** You can also create separate configuration files for each environment (e.g., `appsettings.Development.json`, `appsettings.Staging.json`, `appsettings.Production.json`) and load them based on the `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT` variable:

```csharp
builder.AddJsonFile($"appsettings.{EnvironmentName}.json", optional: true, reloadOnChange: true); 
```

**2. Programmatic Setting:**

You can directly set the environment within your code:

```csharp
var hostBuilder = Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
    .ConfigureHostConfiguration(builder => {
        builder.SetBasePath(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory())
               .AddJsonFile("appsettings.json", optional: true, reloadOnChange: true)
               .AddEnvironmentVariables();
    })
    .ConfigureServices((hostContext, services) => {
        // ... configure services

        services.Configure<MyOptions>(options => {
            options.Environment = "Development"; // Set environment directly
        });
    });
```

**3. Command-Line Arguments:**

You can also accept the environment name as a command-line argument:

```csharp
var hostBuilder = Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
    .ConfigureHostConfiguration(builder => {
        // ... configure host configuration
    })
    .ConfigureServices((hostContext, services) => {
        // ... configure services

        var environment = args.FirstOrDefault(arg => arg.StartsWith("--environment="));

        if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(environment))
        {
            services.Configure<MyOptions>(options => {
                options.Environment = environment.Substring(11); // Extract environment name
            });
        }

    });
```

**Remember:**

- Choose a consistent naming convention for your environments (e.g., "Development", "Staging", "Production").
- Configure your application settings (database connections, API keys, etc.) differently for each environment.
- Use environment variables to avoid hardcoding sensitive information in your code.

By following these steps, you can effectively set the environment in your `.NET Generic Host` application and configure it appropriately for different deployment scenarios.
