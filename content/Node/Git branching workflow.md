# Git branching workflow for single-person development

Yes, there are Git branching workflows suitable for single-person development. While the Git Flow workflow is widely adopted for collaborative development, it can be simplified for solo developers. Here are some best practices and a simplified workflow for single-person development:

## Simplified Git Branching Workflow for Single-Person Development

### 1. Main Branches

- **`main` (or `master`)**: This branch should always contain production-ready code. It represents the latest stable release of your application.
- **`develop`**: This branch is used for integration and testing of new features. It is the branch where all feature branches are merged before being promoted to the `main` branch.

### 2. Supporting Branches

- **Feature Branches**: These branches are used to develop new features. They are created from the `develop` branch and merged back into `develop` once the feature is complete and tested.
    - Naming convention: `feature/feature-name`
- **Release Branches**: These branches are used to prepare for a new production release. They are created from the `develop` branch and merged into both `main` and `develop` once the release is ready.
    - Naming convention: `release/version-number`
- **Hotfix Branches**: These branches are used to quickly fix critical bugs in the production code. They are created from the `main` branch and merged back into both `main` and `develop` once the fix is complete.
    - Naming convention: `hotfix/issue-number`

## Workflow Steps

1. **Feature Development**:
    - Create a new feature branch from `develop`.
    - Develop the feature in the feature branch.
    - Commit changes regularly with meaningful commit messages.
    - Once the feature is complete, merge the feature branch into `develop`.
    - Delete the feature branch.
2. **Release Preparation**:
    - Create a new release branch from `develop`.
    - Prepare the release by updating version numbers, documentation, and performing final testing.
    - Once the release is ready, merge the release branch into `main`.
    - Merge the release branch into `develop` to keep it up to date.
    - Tag the release in the `main` branch.
    - Delete the release branch.
3. **Hotfixes**:
    - Create a new hotfix branch from `main`.
    - Fix the critical bug in the hotfix branch.
    - Commit changes with meaningful commit messages.
    - Merge the hotfix branch into `main`.
    - Merge the hotfix branch into `develop` to keep it up to date.
    - Tag the hotfix in the `main` branch.
    - Delete the hotfix branch.

## Example Commands

Here are some example commands for the simplified workflow:

```
# Create a new feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-feature develop

# Develop the feature and commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature"

# Merge the feature branch into develop
git checkout develop
git merge feature/new-feature
git branch -d feature/new-feature

# Create a new release branch
git checkout -b release/1.0.0 develop

# Prepare the release and commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare for release 1.0.0"

# Merge the release branch into main
git checkout main
git merge release/1.0.0
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"

# Merge the release branch into develop
git checkout develop
git merge release/1.0.0
git branch -d release/1.0.0

# Create a new hotfix branch
git checkout -b hotfix/issue-123 main

# Fix the bug and commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Fix critical bug"

# Merge the hotfix branch into main
git checkout main
git merge hotfix/issue-123
git tag -a v1.0.1 -m "Hotfix for issue 123"

# Merge the hotfix branch into develop
git checkout develop
git merge hotfix/issue-123
git branch -d hotfix/issue-123

```

## Best Practices

1. **Consistent Branch Naming**: Use descriptive and consistent naming conventions for branches to make it clear what each branch is for.
2. **Meaningful Commit Messages**: Write clear and concise commit messages to document the changes made in each commit.
3. **Regular Commits**: Commit changes regularly to keep a history of your work and to make it easier to track changes.
4. **Tagging Releases**: Use tags to mark important milestones, such as releases and hotfixes.
5. **Documentation**: Document your branching workflow to ensure consistency and to make it easier to understand the development process.

## Conclusion

A simplified Git branching workflow is suitable for single-person development. By using main branches (`main` and `develop`) and supporting branches (feature, release, and hotfix branches), you can maintain a clean and organized development process. Consistent branch naming, meaningful commit messages, regular commits, tagging releases, and documentation are key to a successful branching strategy for solo developers.
