# POCO

POCO stands for Plain Old CLR (or Class) Object. It is a term commonly used in the context of object-oriented programming, particularly in the .NET framework. POCO refers to a simple, lightweight class that ==does not have any dependencies on framework-specific base classes or attributes==.

In the .NET world, POCO classes are often used in Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) frameworks, such as Entity Framework, to represent entities in a database. POCO classes are typically plain C# or VB.NET classes that do not inherit from any specific base class or implement any specific interface required by the ORM framework. This makes them independent and easier to work with, as they are not tightly coupled to the framework.

POCO classes are designed to be simple, clean, and focused solely on representing the data and state of an object. They typically consist of properties, fields, and methods that define the object's behavior. POCO classes are often used to map database tables or query results to objects in an application, providing a convenient way to work with data in an object-oriented manner.
