# Serialization in .NET

## JSON serialization and deserialization

Compare the `Newtonsoft.Json` library and the build-in `System.Text.Json` library

###  Comparing Newtonsoft.Json and System.Text.Json

Both `Newtonsoft.Json` and `System.Text.Json` are JSON serialization libraries for .NET, but they have different strengths and weaknesses depending on your needs:

**`Newtonsoft.Json`:**

* **Pros:**

    * **Mature and Feature-Rich:**  Being a third-party library, it has been around longer and benefits from extensive testing and community support. It offers advanced features like custom converters, JSON schema validation, and serialization attributes for complex object mapping scenarios.
    * **Widely Used:** Popular choice for many .NET projects due to its maturity and familiarity.

* **Cons:**

    * **External Dependency:** Requires adding a third-party NuGet package (although `System.Text.Json` is now the recommended way to handle JSON).
    * **Performance Concerns:** Can be slower than other options, especially for large datasets, due to its reliance on reflection for object mapping.

**`.NET System.Text.Json` (built-in):

* **Pros:**

    * **Built-In and Efficient:**  Available directly within .NET, it's highly optimized for performance using the `System.Text.Json` namespace introduced in .NET Core 3.0 and above.
    * **Simple to Use:** Offers a straightforward API for serialization and deserialization tasks, with methods like `JsonConvert.SerializeObject()` and `JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<>()`

* **Cons:**

    * **Less Feature-Rich:** While the built-in library is powerful and efficient, it lacks some of the advanced features offered by Newtonsoft.Json (e.g., custom serialization settings).
    * **Limited Customization:**  The .NET library provides basic control over serialization/deserialization through `JsonSerializerOptions`, but for complex scenarios, you might need to use external libraries like `Newtonsoft.Json` for more fine-grained control over the JSON structure.

**Choosing Between Libraries:**

* For simple serialization and deserialization tasks (e.g., converting basic objects to and from JSON strings), **`.NET System.Text.Json` is generally recommended**. It's faster, built-in, and doesn't require external dependencies.
* For complex object mapping scenarios with custom formatting needs, **consider using `Newtonsoft.Json`**, as it offers a wider range of features through its comprehensive API:

  * **Complex JSON Structures:** You can easily customize the serialization process for different data types and formats using `JsonConverter`s in .NET's `System.Text.Json`.
  * **Data Contracts:** Complex object mapping scenarios are often better handled with a custom approach to define how each property should be represented in the serialized output, simplifying deserialization on other platforms.

* **Use Cases:**

    * `System.Text.Json`:
        * Serializing/deserializing basic data structures for communication (API calls, serialization to files)
        * Performance-critical scenarios within a .NET environment where you need to serialize/deserialize quickly without the overhead of complex type mappings.

    * **`Newtonsoft.Json`:**
        * Complex JSON operations with custom logic and formatting options (e.g., converting between JSON and custom object types).


**In Summary:**

While `System.Text.Json` is a good option for straightforward scenarios, if you need to serialize/deserialize complex data structures or utilize advanced features like JSON schema validation, using `Newtonsoft.Json` might be preferable due to its flexibility.

However, if your data is simple and you don't want to rely on external libraries for every task, the built-in serialization capabilities of `System.Text.Json` will likely suffice. You can use it for complex scenarios as well, but remember that it requires careful consideration when mapping properties.
