If you change entities used in the Application Model (persistent classes, Controllers, etc.) in code, your previous Application Model customization may become unusable. To avoid losing the custom settings, update the Application Model by implementing a converter described in the [Convert Application Model Differences](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/112796/ui-construction/application-model-ui-settings-storage/application-model-storages/handle-application-model-upgrades) topic and clicking **Update Model** in your project's context menu.[^1]
