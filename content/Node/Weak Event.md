what is Weak Event in MVVM application

In the context of MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture, a weak event is a way to handle events in a way that avoids memory leaks. 

In traditional event handling, an object that subscribes to an event of another object holds a reference to the object that raises the event. This can cause memory leaks if the object that subscribes to the event ==is not properly unsubscribed when it is no longer needed==. 

A weak event, on the other hand, uses a weak reference to the object that subscribes to the event. This means that the subscribing object ==can be garbage collected even if it has not been unsubscribed from the event==. 

In MVVM, weak events are often used to handle events raised by the View in a way that allows the ViewModel to respond to them without creating a strong coupling between the two. This helps to keep the ViewModel separate from the View, which is an important principle of the MVVM architecture.
