automatic versioning for AssemblyVersion

The asterisk (\*) in the `<AssemblyVersion>1.0.*</AssemblyVersion>` notation is a special syntax that enables automatic versioning for the last two components of the assembly version. Here's what it means:

1. Format explanation:
   - The assembly version is typically in the format `major.minor.build.revision`
   - In `1.0.*`, the first two numbers (1.0) are fixed
   - The asterisk (\*) tells the compiler to automatically generate the `build` and `revision` numbers

2. Auto-generated numbers:
   - `build`: Represents the number of days since January 1, 2000
   - `revision`: Represents the number of seconds since midnight divided by 2

For example, if you compile your project on June 1, 2023, at 3:30 PM, the resulting assembly version might look something like:

```
1.0.8552.31500
```

Where:
- 1.0 are the fixed major and minor versions
- 8552 is the number of days since January 1, 2000
- 31500 is the number of seconds since midnight divided by 2

This auto-versioning feature can be useful for:
- Ensuring each build has a unique version number
- Tracking when a specific build was created
- Differentiating between builds without manually updating the version

However, it's important to note:
1. This syntax is primarily used for `AssemblyVersion`, not for `FileVersion` or NuGet package versions
2. It can make it harder to correlate specific versions with features or releases
3. It may not be suitable for all versioning strategies, especially for published packages or APIs where consistent, predictable versioning is important

If you decide to use this auto-versioning feature, make sure it aligns with your overall versioning and release strategy.
