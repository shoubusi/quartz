How many ways to initialize values for properties and fields, when I create an instance of a type. Give examples to explain

Kimi:
In C#, there are several ways to initialize values for properties and fields when creating an instance of a type. Here are the common methods with examples:

1. **Default Values**:
   Each .NET type has a default value. For value types, it's typically zero (`0`), and for reference types, it's `null`.

   ```csharp
   public class Example {
       public int ValueTypeField; // Default is 0
       public object ReferenceTypeField; // Default is null
   }
   ```

2. **Field Initializers**:
   You can set initial values for fields directly in the class definition using field initializers.

   ```csharp
   public class Example {
       public int ValueTypeField = 10; // Initialized to 10
       public string ReferenceTypeField = "Default"; // Initialized to "Default"
   }
   ```

3. **Constructor Parameters**:
   You can define a constructor that takes parameters to initialize fields or properties.

   ```csharp
   public class Example {
       public int ValueTypeProperty { get; set; }
       public string ReferenceTypeProperty { get; set; }

       public Example(int valueType, string referenceType) {
           ValueTypeProperty = valueType;
           ReferenceTypeProperty = referenceType;
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Object Initializers**:
   With object initializers, you can set property values at the time of object creation.

   ```csharp
   var example = new Example {
       ValueTypeProperty = 20,
       ReferenceTypeProperty = "Initialized"
   };
   ```

5. **Primary Constructors (C# 12 and later)**:
   Primary constructors allow you to include parameters in the class declaration, which can be used to initialize fields.

   ```csharp
   public class Example(int valueType, string referenceType) {
       public int ValueTypeProperty { get; } = valueType;
       public string ReferenceTypeProperty { get; } = referenceType;
   }
   ```

6. **Record Types**:
   Record types, introduced in C# 9.0, are a new kind of type that provides built-in support for value-based equality and other features. They can be used with primary constructor syntax as well.

   ```csharp
   public record Example(int ValueTypeProperty, string ReferenceTypeProperty);
   ```

7. **With Expressions (C# 11 and later)**:
   With expressions allow you to create a new object by copying an existing one and then modifying its properties.

   ```csharp
   var original = new Example(10, "Original");
   var modified = original with { ValueTypeProperty = 30, ReferenceTypeProperty = "Modified" };
   ```

8. **Initializer Collections**:
   For collections, you can initialize them inline with values.

   ```csharp
   public class Example {
       public List<string> Items { get; set; } = new List<string> { "Item1", "Item2" };
   }
   ```

Each of these methods can be used depending on the scenario and the specific requirements of your code. For example, field initializers are useful for setting constant values, constructors are great for mandatory initialization, and object initializers provide a convenient way to set values at the point of object creation.
