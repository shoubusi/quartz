list the drawing types plantuml can do


PlantUML supports several types of diagrams. Here are some of the main drawing types it can create:

1. Class Diagrams: Represent classes, their attributes, methods, and relationships (e.g., associations, inheritances).

2. Object Diagrams: Show instances of classes and their interactions at a particular point in time.

3. Sequence Diagrams: Illustrate the interaction between objects over time, focusing on the dynamics of the system.

4. Activity Diagrams: Depict the flow of control and data exchange among different activities or sub-activities in a system.

5. Use Case Diagrams: Show the high-level view of a system's functionality by representing actors (users) and their interactions with use cases (requirements).

6. Component Diagrams: Display the organization of components within a system, showing their relationships and dependencies.

7. Deployment Diagrams: Represent the physical deployment of artifacts on the target environment, including nodes, components, and nodes.

8. State Diagrams: Illustrate the different states an object can be in and the transitions between those states.

9. Timing Diagrams: Show how behaviors change over time based on specific stimuli or events.

10. Part Diagrams: Represent parts and their composition within a system.

11. Activity Group Diagrams: Group activities together for better organization and readability in activity diagrams.

12. Pseudocode (Textual) Diagrams: Provide a textual representation of algorithms or procedures using pseudocode syntax.

13. User Story Diagrams: Depict user stories and their acceptance criteria in a visual format.

14. ER (Entity-Relationship) Diagrams: Show the entities, attributes, relationships, and constraints within a database system.

15. NLP (Natural Language Processing) Diagrams: Represent the flow of information and processing steps in an NLP pipeline.

16. API Gateway Diagrams: Illustrate the architecture of an API gateway and its interactions with downstream services or microservices.

17. System entity relationship diagrams (SERD): Show the high-level entities, attributes, relationships within a system, and their interdependencies.

These are some of the main drawing types supported by PlantUML. The library is actively developed and may include additional diagram types or improvements over time.
