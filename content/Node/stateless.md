# stateless in the context of Application Services

In computing, "stateless" refers to a system or component that does not retain information about the state of previous interactions. In the context of Application Services, being stateless means that each request is handled independently, without relying on any previous requests or storing any session-specific data.

Stateless components do not maintain any internal state between requests, which can lead to simpler and more scalable systems. Each request received by a stateless component contains all the necessary information for processing, and the component produces a response based solely on the input provided in that specific request.

For Application Services, being stateless allows them to be more easily distributed, scaled, and maintained because they do not rely on shared state or context between requests. This design choice simplifies the handling of concurrent requests and promotes better separation of concerns within the application architecture.
