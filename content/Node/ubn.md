In English dictionary definitions, the abbreviation "ubn" stands for "used before noun", which means "used before a noun". This is often used to indicate the typical use of an adjective in a sentence, i.e. as a word modifying a noun. "Ubn" is opposed to "obn" (only before noun), "ubn" means that an adjective can be used before a noun and can be used elsewhere.
